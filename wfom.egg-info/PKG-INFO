Description: # Wide Field Optical Mapping (WFOM)
        
        This project is meant to create a streamlined interface to interact with Wide Field Optical Mapping (WFOM) Imaging Systems. 
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will help you get the necessary software installed onto your PC.
        
        ### Computer Requirements
        
        ```
        Windows (8, 8.1, 10)
        4GB RAM
        2.68 GHZ Quad Core
        850 MB/s continuous write Hard Drive
        ```
        ### Software Requirements
        
        * [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - 3.7 and Up
        * [Java Runtime](https://java.com/en/download/) - 1.8 and Up
        * [Andor SOLIS (4.30 and up)](http://www.andor.com/downloads) - Registration Required
        * [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) - Latest Version
        
        ### Installing
        
        A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
        
        Say what the step will be
        
        ```
        Give the example
        ```
        
        And repeat
        
        ```
        until finished
        ```
        
        End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
        
        ## Running the tests
        
        Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
        
        ### Break down into end to end tests
        
        Explain what these tests test and why
        
        ```
        Give an example
        ```
        
        ### And coding style tests
        
        Explain what these tests test and why
        
        ```
        Give an example
        ```
        
        ## Deployment
        
        Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
